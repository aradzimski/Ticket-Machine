# Ticket-Machine

Team:
- Kamil Wszeborowski (s16215)
- Adrian Radzimski (s15852)

We plan to create an application for the club called "Machine", which will improve the sale of tickets confirming the possibility of entering the club. Currently, clubs sell tickets in paper form through promoters or during the event before entering the club (no longer as a paper ticket but in the form of a stamp).

Application will contain various functions, depending on who uses it:

Club owner:
1. Log in to your account
2. Adding new events, determining the price for enter

Customers:
1. Preview of organized events in the club
2. You can buy a ticket - it will be available as a QR code

Bodyguards:
1. Log in to your account
2. Reading QR codes to check if the customer has bought enter to the event
